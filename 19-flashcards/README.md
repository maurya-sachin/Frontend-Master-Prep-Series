## 🎓 Study Strategies

### 1. Active Recall
- Read question
- Cover answer
- Try to answer out loud
- Check if correct
- If wrong, understand why

### 2. Feynman Technique
- After answering, explain concept as if teaching a beginner
- If you can't explain simply, you don't understand it well

### 3. Interleaving
- Don't do all cards from one topic
- Mix topics for better retention
- Use curated decks that mix topics

### 4. Testing Effect
- Quiz yourself regularly
- Don't just read - actively recall
- Makes retrieval stronger
