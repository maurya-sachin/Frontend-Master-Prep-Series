## 🎓 Study Techniques

### 1. Active Recall (Most Effective)
- Use flashcards daily
- Don't just read - quiz yourself
- Explain concepts out loud
- **Time:** 15-30 min daily

### 2. Spaced Repetition
- Review on days: 1, 3, 7, 14, 30
- Focus more time on difficult cards
- Use our flashcard system
- **Time:** 15-20 min daily

### 3. Feynman Technique
- Pick a concept
- Explain it to a 5-year-old (or rubber duck)
- Identify gaps in understanding
- Simplify and repeat
- **Time:** 10-15 min per concept

### 4. Pomodoro Technique
- Study for 25 minutes
- Break for 5 minutes
- After 4 pomodoros, take 15-30 min break
- Prevents burnout
- **Time:** Entire study session

### 5. Project-Based Learning
- Build real projects
- Apply concepts immediately
- Learn by doing
- **Time:** Weekends (4-8 hours)
