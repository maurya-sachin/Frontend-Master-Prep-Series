## 🎯 Learning Path

### For Beginners (1-2 years experience)

**Start Here:**

1. **Core Concepts** - Understand primitives, hoisting, scope
2. **Functions & Binding** - Master this keyword and function contexts
3. **Objects & Prototypes** - Learn prototypal inheritance
4. **Data Structures** - Arrays, objects, basic algorithms

**Skip for now:**

- Memory & Engine (too advanced initially)
- Advanced Behavior (learn after mastering basics)

### For Intermediate (3-4 years experience)

**Focus Areas:**

1. **Execution Context & Event Loop** - Critical for interviews
2. **Asynchronous JavaScript** - Promises, async/await patterns
3. **Modules & Patterns** - Code organization and best practices
4. **Advanced Behavior** - Proxies, generators, advanced features

### For Senior (5-6 years experience)

**Deep Dive:**

1. **Memory & Engine** - V8 optimization, performance
2. **Advanced Behavior** - Meta-programming, advanced patterns
3. All sections - Aim for mastery of every concept
