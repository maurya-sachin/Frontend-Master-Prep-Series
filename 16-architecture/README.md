# Architecture & System Design

> **Coming Soon: 25-30 comprehensive Q&A on frontend architecture and system design patterns**

This section will cover architectural patterns, design decisions, and system design concepts critical for senior frontend engineering roles.

---

## 📚 Planned Topics

### 1️⃣ Micro-Frontend Architecture
- Module Federation
- Micro-apps vs monoliths
- Communication patterns between micro-frontends
- Deployment strategies
- Shared dependencies management

### 2️⃣ Component Architecture
- Atomic Design principles
- Component composition patterns
- Design system architecture
- Component library development
- Versioning and distribution

### 3️⃣ State Management Architecture
- Global vs local state decisions
- State management patterns (Redux, Zustand, Jotai, MobX)
- Server state vs client state
- Caching strategies
- Optimistic updates

### 4️⃣ Scalability Patterns
- Code splitting strategies
- Lazy loading patterns
- Bundle optimization
- Performance at scale
- Progressive enhancement

### 5️⃣ Design Patterns
- Factory, Singleton, Observer patterns in frontend
- Pub/Sub architecture
- Dependency injection
- Module patterns
- HOC and render props patterns

### 6️⃣ API Architecture
- REST vs GraphQL decisions
- API client architecture
- Request batching and deduplication
- Error handling strategies
- Retry and timeout policies

### 7️⃣ Observability & Monitoring
- Error tracking setup
- Performance monitoring
- User analytics integration
- Logging best practices
- Debugging strategies
